# data-plotter
Rust WASM data plotter

Recreation of [a website](https://www.stapplet.com/) used in my statistics class, except not in light mode because I'm tired of getting my eyes seared every time I open up the website

A demo of the current graph/plot types currently accepted can be viewed [here](https://yellowly.github.io/data-plotter), but values to plot can not yet be inputted.
